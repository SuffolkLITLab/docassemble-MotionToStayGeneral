    Examples
  content: |
    * For example, if the Trial Court judge's order is unreasonable in light of the facts that that the judge heard at the hearing or trial, the issue of law would be whether the judge's order was an abuse of discretion.
    * For example, if you thought the judge mistakenly did not allow you to present a piece of evidence at the hearing or trial, the issue of law would be whether the judge improperly excluded evidence at the hearing or trial.
